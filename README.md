## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The purpose of this project is to conduct research on the paper entitled "[Learning of Cluster-based Feature Importance for Electronic Health Record Time-series](https://lnkd.in/d3kT-RRe)". This paper introduces a novel approach to learning cluster-based feature importance for electronic health record (EHR) time-series data. The authors present the model CAMELOT, which combines time-series K-means with the encoder-decoder network. The efficacy of the model is validated on two real-world EHR datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing feature selection methods in terms of robustness and interoperability.

To gain a better understanding of the model, we intend to reproduce the model from scratch, replicate the experiments, test our hypotheses, and document our findings.
