- Data Instructions (MIMIC-IV):

  - Download the [MIMIC-IV-ED](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ed/1.0/)
  - Download the core directory from [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/1.0/)
  - Download the [data preprocessing pipeline](https://github.com/hrna-ox/camelot-icml/tree/main/src/data_processing/MIMIC)
  - Run the scripts by `python run_processing.py` (You need to be careful about the directory structure)

- Run one of the notebooks: Showcase.ipynb, ablation_ours.ipynb, and ablation_paper.ipynb.

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

The purpose of this project is to conduct research on the paper entitled "[Learning of Cluster-based Feature Importance for Electronic Health Record Time-series](https://lnkd.in/d3kT-RRe)". This paper introduces a novel approach to learning cluster-based feature importance for electronic health record (EHR) time-series data. The authors present the model CAMELOT, which combines time-series K-means with the encoder-decoder network. The efficacy of the model is validated on two real-world EHR datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing feature selection methods in terms of robustness and interoperability.

To gain a better understanding of the model, we intend to reproduce the model from scratch, replicate the experiments, test our hypotheses, and document our findings.
